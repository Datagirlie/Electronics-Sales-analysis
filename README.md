Growing up as a young lad, Mr Wang have always dreamed of owning his own business and being his own boss. This finally became a reality for him in 2019, when he opened the **Yang Electronics Stores**, shortly after retiring as an electrical engineer from an automobile company. The business have expanded over the years to different states in the US, from selling electronic accessories(cables, wires, battries, headphones) to selling household elctronics(TVs, Dryers, Washing machine) and even gadgets (Phones, Laptops, Monitor). 


## Problem Statement

As a regular customer to the yang electronic stores in Bouston, I came in on a sunny afternoon to purchase an item, when Mr Wang shared his burden with me about not being able to understand the data collected from sales since 2019. He is planning to expand next year, and he needed to know the following from his data:
- Sales trend over the years.
- Identify the best selling Products
- How much he made and how many products were sold.
- What month had the highest sales.
- Which city made the mmost sales.

I shared my knowledge with with him about data and analysing data, he seemed quite impressed with my knowledge. I assured him that i will look into his data and give him feedback. "Please try your best, my business expansion is counting on this analysis", those were Mr Wang's words as i retrieved the data.
