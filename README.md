Growing up as a young lad, Mr Wang have always dreamed of having his own business and being his own boss. This finally became a reality for him in 2019, when he opened the **Yang Electronics Store**, shortly after retiring as an electrical engineer from an automobile company. The business expanded over the year into 9 major cities in the US, from selling electronic accessories (cables, wires, battries, headphones) to selling household elctronic devices (TVs, Dryers, Washing machines) and even gadgets (Phones, Laptops, Monitors). 


## Problem Statement.

As a regular customer to the Yang Electronics Store in Boston, I came in on a sunny afternoon to purchase an item, when Mr Wang shared his burden with me about not being able to understand the data collected from sales since his business started last year. He is planning to expand his business into other cities this new year, and he needed to know the following from his data:
- What were the best selling Products
- How much he made and how many products were sold.
- What month had the highest sales.
- Which city made the most sales.
- Which city to expand in and also what products are most needed in the cities

I shared my knowledge with him about data and analysing data. He was impressed with my knowledge and happy that someone finally understood him. I assured him that i will look into his data, analyze it and give him feedback to ease his burden. "Please i'm relying heavily on you,this analysis will determine my business expansion", those were Mr Wang's words as i retrieved the data.

# Analysis.
## Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Going through the data, i was really impressed with how organised the data was arranged. The data contained sales data from january 2019 up until january 2020, with **11 coloums** and **185,951 rows** all of which contained data in their cells. There were no **NULL VALUES, BLANK CELLS and INCONSISTENCY** of data. All data was complete and properly formatted in each column. 
Kudos to the data collection team.

The only thing i did was to boldly highlight the column headings, format the numbers in **_Price Each_** and **_Sales_** columns and finally sort the data from oldest to newest from the _**order date**_ column, to be able to understand the data from the first day of purchase until the last day. Also, to be able to understand the revenue metrics, i created a calculated field with Pivot tables in excel, to calculate the Total Revenue generated, Total Quantity of items Ordered, Average Revenue, Profit generated and Profit Margin .

## Revenue Metrics:
Throughout the year, **200,431 units** of items were ordered throughout the whole of US from the Yang electronics stores, which generated a total revenue of  **$34,492,035.97** and an average revenue of **$185.4909** from sales of these items. Based on the data the total sum of each item  cost **$34,289,130.68**, however from the sales value, **$202,905.29** was generated as total profit from the items sold. The sales generated a profit margin of **0.58** which is **58.83%**, this figure was generated by dividing the profit from the revenue and multiplying by 100: 
                                           
                                                   Profit margin=(Profit/Revenue) * 100.

This profit margin simply means for every **$1** of revenue, the business makes a profit of **$0.58**, which makes the profit margin to be significantly **POSITIVE**, as the average profit margin for electronics stores is around **6.7%** . This however indicates that Yang Electronics Store is efficient in their operations and also very adept in managinging their expenses.

## Sales/Products Orderd Per Month:
December is the month with the highest number of items ordered. A total of **28,114** items were ordered, AAA battries(42,41 items) being the highest number of item ordered and LG washing machine(80 items) being the lowest. Also a total sales of **$4,613,443.34** was generated in December which stands out as the month with the highest sales made and also with the highest profit of **$25,07.93**.

In January sales and items ordered were the lowest, even though it is the combined sales and ordered of January 2019 and January 2020. **$1,822,256.73** was generated from sales with a profit of **$10,488.35**.

## Product Sales and Quantity Ordered.
Macbook Pro have the highest total sales of **$8,037,600** generated and AAA batteries with the lowest total sales of **$92,740.83**. Based on qantiity of product of ordered, AAA batteries have the highest number of items orderd(31,017 items) and LG Dryer with the lowest order of 646 items orderd. Notice that, Macbook Pro have the highest number of sales but not the highest number of product ordered and AAA Batteries have the lowest sales, but the highest number of product ordered. This can be attributed to the major differenece in price of each item. Macbook Pro is sold at **$1,700** for 1 quantity and AAA batteries at **$2.99**. Even if 500 AAA batteries are sold per day, it won't still generate more sales than 1 Macbook Pro sold per day.

However, AAA batteries have the highest quantity ordered, not only because it is affordable but beacsue it is also a major elctronic accessory that is used everywhere. Everyone makes use of batteries, whether it is in the school,home,church,mall, offices etc.

## City Sales.

San Francisco is a global center of economic activity spurred by leading univeristies, world leading high-tech hubs, healthcare and professional services sector. The total sales generated from product sold in San Francisco is **$8.03M** and a total **48,153** units of products was ordered which is the highest from all 9 cities where the stores are located. This is no suprise, because San Fracisco is one of the major hubs of high-tech companies and leading universities in technology, which is a major advantage to Yang Electronics Store, because of the high demand in gadgets which are the most expensive items and other electronic accesories. However, Austin has the lowest sale of **$1.79M** and **10,701** which is the lowest unit of quanity ordered from all stores in the 9 cities.

# Conclusion and  Reccomendations.
Base on this data, this business is on a good note for expansion. The policies set to run this business have helped it to grow a very high profit margin in just 1 year, which is a great start.

However, for continuity of sales and increase in profit i would reccomend the following:
- More stores can be opened in San Francisco to help cause more revenue in the sales.
- Adding more gadgets acessories like airpods, phone chargers can also help to increase the sales of items, especially in cities like Austin that have low sales and people buy more accessories than gadgets.
- Identify the most recquired and sold item in each city and stock up product based on what is demanded in that city.
- Before any new store in open in any city, a survey should be carried out to know the type of electronics mostly used based on lifestyle and professional services by the people in that city. This will help in purchasig the right items for sale in that region.
