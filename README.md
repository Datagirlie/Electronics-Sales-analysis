Growing up as a young lad, Mr Wang have always dreamed of owning his own business and being his own boss. This finally became a reality for him in 2019, when he opened the **Yang Electronics Stores**, shortly after retiring as an electrical engineer from an automobile company. The business have expanded over the year to different states in the US, from selling electronic accessories(cables, wires, battries, headphones) to selling household elctronic devices(TVs, Dryers, Washing machines) and even gadgets (Phones, Laptops, Monitors). 


## Problem Statement

As a regular customer to the yang electronic stores in Bouston, I came in on a sunny afternoon to purchase an item, when Mr Wang shared his burden with me about not being able to understand the data collected from sales since his business started this year. He is planning to expand the next year, and he needed to know the following from his data:
- What were the best selling Products
- How much he made and how many products were sold.
- What month had the highest sales.
- Which city made the most sales.

I shared my knowledge with him about data and analysing data. He was impressed with my knowledge and happy that someone finally understood what him. I assured him that i will look into his data, analyze it and give him feedback. "Please try your best, my business expansion is counting on this analysis", those were Mr Wang's words as i retrieved the data.

# Analysis
## Data Cleaning and Transformation
Going through the data, i was really impressed with how organised the data was arranged. The data contained **11 coloums** and **185,951 rows**, all of which contained data in their cells. There was no NULL VALUES, BLANK CELLS and INCONSISTENCY of data. All data was complete and properly formatted in each column. 
Kudos to the data collection team.

The only thing i did was to boldly highlight the column headings and sort the data from oldest to newest from the _**order date**_ column, to be able to understand the data from the first day of purchase until the last day and draw insights.

## Revenue Metrics
Throughout the year, **200,431 units** of items were ordered throughout the whole of US from the yang electronics stores, which generated a total revenue of  **$34,492,035.97** and an average revenue of **$185.4909** from sales of these items. Based on the data the total sum of each item  cost **$34,289,130.68**, however from the sales value, **$202,905.29** was generated as total profit from the items sold. The sales generated a profit margin of **0.62** which is **62%**, this figure was generated by dividing the profit from the revenue and multiplying by 100, that is: 
                                           
                                                   Profit margin=(Profit/Revenue) * 100.

This profit margin simply means for every **$1** of revenue, the business makes a profit of **$0.62**, which makes the profit margin to be significantly **POSITIVE**, as the average profit margin for electronics stores is around **6.7%** . This however indicates that Yang Electronics Stores is efficient in their operations and also very adept in managinging their expenses.
